# Enhancing-Language-Generation-with-Explainable-AI-Integrating-RAG-LLMs-and-spaCy
The project leverages a sophisticated hybrid NLP architecture that brings together Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and spaCy's advanced linguistic capabilities. This unique combination allows us to move beyond standard language generation to produce content that is efficient, context-aware, and inherently explainable. By integrating structured data retrieval with state-of-the-art generative models and fine-grained text processing, the system ensures more accurate, transparent, and accountable AI outputs, specifically tailored for critical domain-specific applications.


# **1st Step Retrieve:** Extracting Textual Data from PDF Files Using fitz (PyMuPDF)
for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems #

**1.1 Introduction**\
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external data retrieval
mechanisms with generative large language models (LLMs) to enhance
contextual understanding and factual accuracy. A key prerequisite for
effective RAG is the ability to extract and preprocess relevant
documents into queryable text chunks. This report details the process of
extracting data from PDF files using the fitz module from the PyMuPDF
library to support RAG workflows.

**1.2. Objective**\
To extract structured and clean text from PDF documents using Python's
fitz library, preparing the content for indexing and retrieval in a
RAG-based LLM application.

**1.3. Tools and Libraries**

-   **fitz (PyMuPDF)**: A lightweight Python binding for MuPDF, used for
    reading and manipulating PDF files.

-   **Python â‰¥ 3.8**

-   Optional: langchain, faiss, or chromadb for downstream chunking and
    indexing.

**1.4. Methodology**

**1.4.1 Installation**

pip install pymupdf

**1.4.2 Text Extraction Process**
```python
import fitz \# PyMuPDF

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):

doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)

text = \"\"

for page in doc:

text += page.get_text()

doc.close()

return text
```
**1.4.3 Preprocessing**\
After extraction, the text may contain line breaks, headers/footers, or
encoding artifacts. Preprocessing steps may include:

-   Removing newline characters (\\n)

-   Stripping repeated headers/footers

-   Splitting text into semantically coherent chunks (e.g., using
    sentence boundary detection or paragraph segmentation)

**Example**:
```python
import re

def clean_text(raw_text):

\# Remove multiple newlines and normalize whitespace

cleaned = re.sub(r\'\\n+\', \'\\n\', raw_text)

cleaned = re.sub(r\'\[ \]{2,}\', \' \', cleaned)

return cleaned.strip()
```
**1.4.4 Chunking for RAG**\
The cleaned text is split into chunks (e.g., 500 tokens) to optimize
retrieval. Tools such as
langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter or custom
token-based approaches can be used.
```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(

chunk_size=500,

chunk_overlap=50

)

chunks = splitter.split_text(cleaned_text)
```
**1.5. Integration with RAG Pipelines**\
The extracted chunks can be indexed into a vector database (e.g., FAISS,
Chroma, Weaviate). These embeddings are later retrieved during inference
by similarity to user queries and passed into the LLM to improve its
responses.

**1.6. Advantages of Using fitz (PyMuPDF)**

-   Fast parsing of PDFs with high accuracy

-   Retains layout better than pdfminer or PyPDF2

-   Supports advanced operations such as annotation parsing or image
    extraction (if required)

**1.7. Limitations**

-   Complex layouts (e.g., multi-column, embedded tables) may still
    require layout-aware post-processing

-   Non-text PDFs (scanned images) require OCR (e.g., with Tesseract or
    PaddleOCR)

**1.8. Conclusion**\
The fitz module provides a robust and efficient means to extract text
from PDF documents, a critical step in building a knowledge base for
RAG-powered LLM systems. When combined with effective preprocessing and
chunking, this approach enables accurate and context-rich responses from
LLMs by grounding them in reliable source documents.


# **Title:** Augmentation in RAG Systems Using dot_score for Similarity-Based Retrieval

**2.1 Introduction**  
The second critical step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow is augmenting the user query with the most relevant document chunks. This augmentation process requires accurately retrieving text segments from a pre-indexed knowledge base that are semantically similar to the query. One efficient method to achieve this is by using dot product similarity via the dot_score function from the sentence_transformers utility module.

**2.2 Objective**  
To describe the role of similarity scoring using dot_score in enhancing the document retrieval and augmentation stage of RAG pipelines, ensuring the LLM is grounded in the most relevant context.

**2.3 Tools and Libraries**

- **sentence_transformers**: A Python library for embedding text and computing semantic similarity.
- **PyTorch**: Backend used by sentence_transformers.

**2.4 Embedding and Retrieval Strategy**

**2.4.1 Embedding Generation**  
Before scoring, both the query and document chunks are embedded into high-dimensional vector representations:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

query_embedding = model.encode(query, convert_to_tensor=True)

chunk_embeddings = model.encode(chunk_list, convert_to_tensor=True)
```
**2.4.2 Similarity Scoring using dot_score**
```python
from sentence_transformers import util

\# Compute dot product similarity scores between query and each chunk

scores = util.dot_score(a=query_embedding, b=chunk_embeddings)\[0\]
```
- a: A tensor representing the query vector
- b: A tensor of document chunk vectors
- dot_score\[a, b\]: Computes dot product between vectors (closely related to cosine similarity if vectors are normalized)

**2.4.3 Selecting Top-k Chunks**  
Once scores are computed, the top-k chunks are selected for use in the input to the LLM:
```python
import torch

top_k = 3

top_results = torch.topk(scores, k=top_k)

relevant_chunks = \[chunk_list\[i\] for i in top_results.indices\]
```
**2.5 Why Use Dot Product Scoring?**

- **Efficient**: Suitable for batch processing and GPU acceleration
- **Effective**: Provides accurate semantic similarity when used with normalized embeddings
- **Compatible**: Works seamlessly with widely-used transformer-based embedding models

**2.6 Application in RAG**  
The selected top-k relevant chunks are appended or prepended to the query prompt sent to the LLM. This contextual grounding ensures:

- Higher factual accuracy
- Better understanding of domain-specific terminology
- Reduced hallucination in generative responses

**2.7 Conclusion**  
The dot_score function plays a pivotal role in the augmentation phase of RAG by enabling rapid, effective similarity matching between user queries and knowledge base documents. By retrieving top-scoring chunks and injecting them into the prompt, RAG-based systems ensure more relevant, coherent, and reliable outputs from large language models.

#3rd step : Generation in RAG Systems Using TinyLlama-1.1B for Context-Aware Response Synthesis

## 3.1 Introduction

The final stage in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is the generation step, where the large language model (LLM) synthesizes an answer based on the original user query augmented with the most relevant retrieved document chunks. This report describes how to implement the generation phase using the TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 model.

## 3.2 Objective

To utilize the TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 model to generate contextually rich and factually accurate responses by conditioning it on both the user query and the relevant retrieved context.

## 3.3 Tools and Libraries

* **transformers**: Hugging Face library for loading pretrained LLMs.
* **PyTorch**: Backend for running model inference.
* **TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0**: A compact yet capable causal LLM.

## 3.4 Loading the Language Model

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0")

# Move the model to GPU if available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
```

## 3.5 Generating the Final Response

### 3.5.1 Constructing the Prompt

The prompt combines the top-k retrieved chunks with the original query:

```python
prompt = """
Context:
{}

Question:
{}
""".format("\n\n".join(relevant_chunks), user_query)
```

### 3.5.2 Tokenizing and Generating Output

```python
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200, do_sample=False)
response = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

## 3.6 Considerations for TinyLlama

* **Lightweight**: Suitable for inference on edge devices with limited resources.
* **Fast Inference**: Achieves low latency on both CPU and GPU.
* **Limitations**: As a smaller model, it may exhibit reduced reasoning depth or factual precision compared to larger models (e.g., LLaMA 2, GPT-3.5).

## 3.7 Use Cases in RAG

* Answering domain-specific queries with verified documentation.
* Enabling LLMs to reference structured data retrieved at runtime.
* Use in chatbots, knowledge assistants, and QA systems.

## 3.8 Conclusion

By leveraging TinyLlama-1.1B in the generation phase of RAG, the system can produce concise and grounded answers conditioned on semantically relevant document content. This step completes the RAG pipeline by transforming retrieved knowledge into actionable and coherent outputs.
