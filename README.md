# Enhancing-Language-Generation-with-Explainable-AI-Integrating-RAG-LLMs-and-spaCy
The project leverages a sophisticated hybrid NLP architecture that brings together Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and spaCy's advanced linguistic capabilities. This unique combination allows us to move beyond standard language generation to produce content that is efficient, context-aware, and inherently explainable. By integrating structured data retrieval with state-of-the-art generative models and fine-grained text processing, the system ensures more accurate, transparent, and accountable AI outputs, specifically tailored for critical domain-specific applications.
