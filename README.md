# Enhancing-Language-Generation-with-Explainable-AI-Integrating-RAG-LLMs-and-spaCy
The project leverages a sophisticated hybrid NLP architecture that brings together Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and spaCy's advanced linguistic capabilities. This unique combination allows us to move beyond standard language generation to produce content that is efficient, context-aware, and inherently explainable. By integrating structured data retrieval with state-of-the-art generative models and fine-grained text processing, the system ensures more accurate, transparent, and accountable AI outputs, specifically tailored for critical domain-specific applications.


***1st Step Retrieve:** Extracting Textual Data from PDF Files Using fitz (PyMuPDF)
for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems***

**1.1 Introduction**\
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external data retrieval
mechanisms with generative large language models (LLMs) to enhance
contextual understanding and factual accuracy. A key prerequisite for
effective RAG is the ability to extract and preprocess relevant
documents into queryable text chunks. This report details the process of
extracting data from PDF files using the fitz module from the PyMuPDF
library to support RAG workflows.

**1.2. Objective**\
To extract structured and clean text from PDF documents using Python's
fitz library, preparing the content for indexing and retrieval in a
RAG-based LLM application.

**1.3. Tools and Libraries**

-   **fitz (PyMuPDF)**: A lightweight Python binding for MuPDF, used for
    reading and manipulating PDF files.

-   **Python â‰¥ 3.8**

-   Optional: langchain, faiss, or chromadb for downstream chunking and
    indexing.

**1.4. Methodology**

**1.4.1 Installation**

pip install pymupdf

**1.4.2 Text Extraction Process**

import fitz \# PyMuPDF

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):

doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)

text = \"\"

for page in doc:

text += page.get_text()

doc.close()

return text

**1.4.3 Preprocessing**\
After extraction, the text may contain line breaks, headers/footers, or
encoding artifacts. Preprocessing steps may include:

-   Removing newline characters (\\n)

-   Stripping repeated headers/footers

-   Splitting text into semantically coherent chunks (e.g., using
    sentence boundary detection or paragraph segmentation)

**Example**:

import re

def clean_text(raw_text):

\# Remove multiple newlines and normalize whitespace

cleaned = re.sub(r\'\\n+\', \'\\n\', raw_text)

cleaned = re.sub(r\'\[ \]{2,}\', \' \', cleaned)

return cleaned.strip()

**1.4.4 Chunking for RAG**\
The cleaned text is split into chunks (e.g., 500 tokens) to optimize
retrieval. Tools such as
langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter or custom
token-based approaches can be used.

from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(

chunk_size=500,

chunk_overlap=50

)

chunks = splitter.split_text(cleaned_text)

**1.5. Integration with RAG Pipelines**\
The extracted chunks can be indexed into a vector database (e.g., FAISS,
Chroma, Weaviate). These embeddings are later retrieved during inference
by similarity to user queries and passed into the LLM to improve its
responses.

**1.6. Advantages of Using fitz (PyMuPDF)**

-   Fast parsing of PDFs with high accuracy

-   Retains layout better than pdfminer or PyPDF2

-   Supports advanced operations such as annotation parsing or image
    extraction (if required)

**1.7. Limitations**

-   Complex layouts (e.g., multi-column, embedded tables) may still
    require layout-aware post-processing

-   Non-text PDFs (scanned images) require OCR (e.g., with Tesseract or
    PaddleOCR)

**1.8. Conclusion**\
The fitz module provides a robust and efficient means to extract text
from PDF documents, a critical step in building a knowledge base for
RAG-powered LLM systems. When combined with effective preprocessing and
chunking, this approach enables accurate and context-rich responses from
LLMs by grounding them in reliable source documents.
